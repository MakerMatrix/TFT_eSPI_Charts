# TFT Charting library for AVRs and other microcontrollers built on top of Bodmer/TFT_eSPI

This library provides a class and methods to produce an XY chart from raw data, rendering it to an SPI display.  It should work with any LCD supported by the TFT_eSPI LCD driver library.

Documentation to come later...make an issue if you have questions in the meantime.
